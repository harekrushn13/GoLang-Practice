# **1. Partitioning vs Sharding Overview**

Both **partitioning** and **sharding** split data into smaller parts to improve performance, but they serve different
goals and work at different levels.

---

## **1.1. Partitioning** — **(Within a Single Database)**

**What is Partitioning?**

- **Partitioning** divides a table into **multiple smaller pieces (partitions)** within the **same database server**.
- Each partition contains a **subset of data**, usually based on a **column's value** (e.g., date, region).
- The database engine knows about all partitions and handles queries automatically.

---

### **Key Features of Partitioning**

- **Single server** hosts all partitions.
- Queries **scan only the relevant partition** (better performance).
- **Partition key** determines where data goes.
- **One schema** — all partitions share the same table structure.

---

### **Example:**

Imagine an `orders` table with 10 million rows.

**Without partitioning:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

- It scans **all 10 million rows** (slow).

**With partitioning (by year):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders
(
    order_id      INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    order_date    DATE,
    total         DECIMAL(10, 2)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025)
);
```

- The query now **only scans the 2024 partition** (faster!).

---

## **1.2. Sharding** — **(Across Multiple Servers)**

**What is Sharding?**

- **Sharding** splits data across **multiple servers (shards)** — each shard is essentially a **separate, self-contained
  database**.
- Each shard holds a **subset of data**.
- The app (or a proxy) decides which shard gets the data, not the database engine itself.

---

### **Key Features of Sharding**

- **Distributed across multiple servers** (scales horizontally).
- **Sharding key** determines which shard stores a row.
- **Independent databases** — each shard is a full DB instance.
- **Resilience** — if one shard fails, others may still work.

---

### **Example:**

A social media app has **100 million user profiles**.

**Without sharding:**

- One massive user table on one server — slow, expensive to scale.

**With sharding (by user_id):**

- **Shard 1**: user_ids `1 - 10M`
- **Shard 2**: user_ids `10M - 20M`
- **Shard 3**: user_ids `20M - 30M`
- **...**

When user 23 logs in:

- App routes the query to **Shard 3** directly — faster and scalable.

# **2. Key Differences: Partitioning vs Sharding**

| Feature              | Partitioning  (Single Server)           | Sharding  (Multiple Servers)          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Improve query performance               | Handle massive datasets, scale        |
| **Where it happens** | Within a **single** database server     | Across **multiple** servers           |
| **Control**          | Database engine manages partitions      | App or proxy decides shard routing    |
| **Schema**           | **Single schema**, shared by partitions | Each shard is an **independent DB**   |
| **Failure Handling** | Whole DB fails if server fails          | Other shards may still run            |
| **Scaling**          | Limited to one server’s capacity        | Scales horizontally with more servers |
| **Joins**            | Easier, within partitions               | Cross-shard joins are **complex**     |

# **3. When to Use Partitioning vs Sharding?**

---

### **3.1. Use Partitioning when:**

- Data fits on **one server** but is **too large for a single table**.
- Queries frequently **filter by a column** (e.g., date, region).
- Need **fast deletes** (drop a partition instead of deleting rows).
- Example:
    - **Log data partitioned by month**
    - **E-commerce orders partitioned by region**

---

### **3.2. Use Sharding when:**

- **One server can’t handle** the data or traffic.
- Need **horizontal scaling** (add more servers).
- Want **load balancing** across shards.
- Example:
    - **Social media user profiles sharded by user_id**
    - **Global SaaS app with customers in different regions**

---

---

# **4. Can You Combine Partitioning and Sharding?**

Yes — **Hybrid setups** exist:

**Sharding + Partitioning inside each shard**

- Each shard holds **partitions** (e.g., a time-based partitioned table inside each shard).
- Example:
    - **Global logs system:**
        - **Shard by region** (US, Europe, Asia servers).
        - **Partition logs by month** inside each shard.

# **5. Final Takeaways**

| Scenario                                    | Best Choice                            |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Improve query performance on one server** | **Partitioning**                       |
| **Distribute load across multiple servers** | **Sharding**                           |
| **Handle time-series or range-based data**  | **Partitioning (Range/List)**          |
| **Scale beyond one machine's capacity**     | **Sharding (Hash or Range Shard Key)** |
